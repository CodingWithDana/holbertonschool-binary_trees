Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

Terminal:
alex@/tmp/binary_trees$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 binary_tree_print.c 1-main.c 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 1-left
alex@/tmp/binary_trees$ ./1-left
